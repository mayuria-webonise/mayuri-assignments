The problem occured after solving the git rebase in local repo is that the commit changes are not reflected in github repo.
so for that we need to pull the repo and it will show merge conflict after solving that conflict we can push

if we are sure that we dont want remote changes then we can force push the local ones or we can review the status using force-with-lease

to avoid this situation we should not push branch untill the work is completed on that branch or we can push only after rebasing

steps after solving rebase conflict and creating PR showing merge conflict

1) git problem with push asking me to pull the changes
2) tried git pull for gitreview branch showing merge conflict for a file
3) solved the merge conflict by editing file, keeping all the changes
4) added and commited the changes
5) again pushed the gitreview branch
6) solved the error in PR.
